				"Filled with the kind of sublime, galvanizing stories that strike like a lightning bolt, searing your nerves . . . It's easy enough to see why Kim . . . is acclaimed as the best writer of his generation; pick up this book and find out for yourself." - Nylon <br><br>

				It's been twenty-five years since I last murdered someone, or has it been twenty-six? <br><br>

				Diary of a Murderer captivates and provokes in equal measure, exploring what it means to be on the edge - between life and death, good and evil. In the titular novella, a former serial killer suffering from memory loss sets his sights on one final target: his daughter's boyfriend, who he suspects is also a serial killer. In other stories we witness an affair between two childhood friends that questions the limits of loyalty and love; a family's disintegration after a baby son is kidnapped and recovered years later; and a wild, erotic ride about pursuing creativity at the expense of everything else.<br>
				From "one of South Korea's best and most worldly writers" (NPR), Diary of a Murderer is chilling and high-powered all the way through.<br><br>

				"Kim is expert at finding the humanity inside the other, the comedy inside the tragedy, and the twisted within the seemingly normal." - CrimeReads</p>
